# Adafruit Metro RP2040 BSP (Ada)

This BSP provides simplified abstractions over the RP2040's peripherals to make
it easier to prototype with Arduino-compatible shields.

Much functionality of the RP2040 is not exposed here, use
[rp2040_hal](https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rp2040_hal) directly if you need
more complex behavior.
